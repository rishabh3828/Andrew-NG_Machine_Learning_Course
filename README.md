# Andrew-NG_Machine_Learning_Course

My solutions to the machine learning course by Andrew Ng on coursera.

The focus is on making the code as vectorized as possible. However I was not able to achieve it completely.In some cases having a vectorized code may have led to more complications but I trust it to run faster. Better solutions are welcome.
